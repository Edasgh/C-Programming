Great set of questions 👌 Let’s go one by one.

---

## **1. How the Bisection method finds a root**

* The **Bisection Method** is a bracketing method for solving $f(x) = 0$.
* If you have two points $a$ and $b$ such that:

  $$
  f(a) \cdot f(b) < 0
  $$

  then by the **Intermediate Value Theorem**, at least one root lies between $a$ and $b$.
* The method:

  1. Compute the midpoint $c = \frac{a+b}{2}$.
  2. Check the sign of $f(c)$:

     * If $f(a) \cdot f(c) < 0$, the root lies in $[a, c]$, so set $b = c$.
     * Else, the root lies in $[c, b]$, so set $a = c$.
  3. Repeat until the interval is sufficiently small.
* Each step **halves the interval**, “bisecting” it → hence the name.

---

## **2. Stopping criterion in Bisection**

The algorithm must stop after a finite number of steps. Common criteria are:

* **Interval size**: stop when

  $$
  |b - a| < \varepsilon
  $$

  where $\varepsilon$ is a tolerance for root accuracy.
* **Function value**: stop if

  $$
  |f(c)| < \varepsilon
  $$
* **Iteration limit**: stop if a maximum number of iterations is reached.
* Often, a combination is used (both error tolerance and max iterations).

---

## **3. Why the method guarantees convergence**

* As long as:

  * $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, and
  * $f(a)\cdot f(b) < 0$,
* Then a root must exist within the interval.
* The interval is halved each iteration, so it shrinks geometrically:

  $$
  \text{Error after } n \text{ steps } \leq \frac{b-a}{2^n}
  $$
* Thus, the method **always converges** to a root within the interval, though it may be slow.

## **4. Bisection vs Newton-Raphson**

| Feature           | **Bisection Method**                     | **Newton-Raphson Method**                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Convergence**   | Guaranteed (if sign change)              | Not guaranteed (depends on derivative & initial guess) |
| **Speed**         | Linear (slow, halves interval each step) | Quadratic (very fast if guess is close)                |
| **Requirements**  | Only continuity & sign change            | Requires derivative $f'(x)$ and good initial guess     |
| **Robustness**    | Very reliable                            | Can diverge or oscillate if guess is poor              |
| **Error control** | Easy, directly tied to interval size     | Harder, depends on function behavior                   |

---

## **5. Can Bisection be used for functions without a sign change?**

* **No, not directly.**
  The method relies on the condition $f(a)\cdot f(b) < 0$.
* If both $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ are positive (or both negative), then:

  * The Intermediate Value Theorem gives no guarantee of a root inside.
  * The method cannot decide which half contains a root.
* Exceptions:

  * If $f(c) = 0$ exactly at midpoint, then you found a root directly.
  * If the function touches the x-axis (tangent root) but does not change sign, Bisection **fails** to detect it unless you already bracketed exactly at the root.

---

✅ **In summary:**

* Bisection is slow but guaranteed to converge if conditions hold.
* Newton-Raphson is much faster but can fail without good starting points.
* Bisection requires a sign change, so it cannot detect tangent roots or roots in regions without opposite signs.

---

Would you like me to also **illustrate this with a small diagram** (interval halving and sign-checking) to make the intuition more visual?


Perfect set of questions 👌 Let’s go step by step.

## **1. Formula for Simpson’s 1/3rd rule**

Simpson’s **1/3rd Rule** approximates the integral of a function $f(x)$ over $[a, b]$ by fitting parabolas through every pair of subintervals.

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\,dx \;\approx\; \frac{h}{3}\Big[f(x_0) + 4\sum_{\text{odd } i=1}^{n-1} f(x_i) + 2\sum_{\text{even } i=2}^{n-2} f(x_i) + f(x_n)\Big]
$$

where:

* $n$ = number of subintervals (must be **even**),
* $h = \dfrac{b-a}{n}$,
* $x_i = a + i h$.

---

## **2. Requirements for applying Simpson’s 1/3rd rule**

* Function $f(x)$ should be reasonably **smooth and continuous** on $[a,b]$.
* The interval $[a, b]$ must be divided into an **even number of subintervals** (so that parabolas can be fitted).
* Step size $h$ should be equal for all subintervals (uniform spacing).

---

## **3. Difference from the Trapezoidal Rule**

| Feature             | **Trapezoidal Rule**                                      | **Simpson’s 1/3rd Rule**                                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Curve approximation | Approximates curve with **straight lines** between points | Approximates curve with **parabolas**                                        |
| Requirement         | Works with any number of intervals                        | Requires **even number** of intervals                                        |
| Formula             | $\tfrac{h}{2}[f(x_0) + 2\sum f(x_i) + f(x_n)]$            | $\tfrac{h}{3}[f(x_0) + 4\sum f(\text{odd}) + 2\sum f(\text{even}) + f(x_n)]$ |
| Accuracy            | Order $O(h^2)$                                            | Order $O(h^4)$                                                               |
| Speed               | Easier, less accurate                                     | More accurate for same $n$                                                   |

---

## **4. Can Simpson’s 1/3rd rule be applied to an odd number of intervals? Why not?**

* **No**, because Simpson’s 1/3rd rule groups intervals in pairs (each parabola covers 2 subintervals).
* If $n$ is odd, you will have **one leftover interval**.
* In practice, people often combine Simpson’s 1/3rd rule (for even intervals) with the **Trapezoidal rule** (for the leftover one).

---

## **5. Order of accuracy**

* The error term in Simpson’s 1/3rd rule is:

$$
E = -\frac{(b-a)}{180}h^4 f^{(4)}(\xi), \quad \xi \in [a,b]
$$

* This means it has an **order of accuracy $O(h^4)$**.
* In contrast, Trapezoidal rule is only $O(h^2)$.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* Formula: $\frac{h}{3}[f(x_0) + 4f(x_1)+2f(x_2)+...+f(x_n)]$.
* Requires **even number of subintervals**.
* More accurate than Trapezoidal rule because it uses parabolas.
* Accuracy order: $O(h^4)$.
* Cannot be directly applied for odd $n$; mix with Trapezoidal rule instead.

---

Would you like me to also prepare a **worked numerical example** (say, integrating $\int_0^2 (x^2+1)\,dx$) to illustrate the difference between Simpson’s 1/3rd and Trapezoidal?


Great 👌 Let’s go through the Newton–Raphson method step by step.

---

## **1. Explanation of the Newton–Raphson Method**

* The Newton–Raphson method is an **iterative root-finding technique** for solving equations of the form:

  $$
  f(x) = 0
  $$
* It uses the **first derivative** of the function to improve an initial guess for the root.
* Starting from an initial guess $x_0$, the method repeatedly refines the guess using tangent lines until it converges to a root.

---

## **2. Iteration Formula**

The iterative formula is:

$$
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
$$

where:

* $f(x_n)$ is the function value at the current guess,
* $f'(x_n)$ is the derivative at that point.

The process is repeated until:

$$
|x_{n+1} - x_n| < \varepsilon \quad \text{or} \quad |f(x_{n+1})| < \varepsilon
$$

(for some small tolerance $\varepsilon$).

---

## **3. Geometric Interpretation**

* At each iteration, you **draw the tangent line** to the curve $y = f(x)$ at the point $(x_n, f(x_n))$.
* The tangent line intersects the x-axis at a new point $x_{n+1}$.
* This new point is taken as the improved approximation of the root.
* Repeating this process makes the guesses converge rapidly to the actual root (if conditions are good).

👉 In simple terms: *Newton-Raphson uses tangent lines to “slide down” to the root.*

---

## **4. How to Choose the Initial Guess**

* A good initial guess $x_0$ is crucial for convergence:

  * It should be **close to the actual root** (otherwise the method may diverge or converge to a different root).
  * Typically chosen from **graphical inspection** or by checking intervals where the function changes sign (like in bisection).
  * Ensure $f'(x_0) \neq 0$ (derivative not zero at guess).
  * A rule of thumb: if $f(x)$ is continuous and smooth, pick $x_0$ such that $f(x_0)\cdot f''(x_0) > 0$. This helps ensure convergence.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* Newton–Raphson method: iterative root-finding using tangents.
* Formula: $x_{n+1} = x_n - \dfrac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$.
* Geometric meaning: intersection of tangent with x-axis.
* Initial guess: pick near the root, with $f'(x_0) \neq 0$, often guided by plotting or interval analysis.

Would you like me to also **show a worked example** (say solving $\sqrt{x} = 0$ or $x^3 - x - 2 = 0$) with 2–3 iterations to demonstrate how the formula works in practice?
