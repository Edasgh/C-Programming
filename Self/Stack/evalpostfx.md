This C program evaluates a **postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) expression** using a **stack-based approach**. Here's how it works:

### **Approach Used:**
1. **Stack Data Structure:**  
   - A stack (`Stack[MAX]`) is used to store operands during the evaluation process.
   - The `push()` and `pop()` functions are used to manipulate the stack.

2. **Parsing the Postfix Expression:**
   - The input expression (`char *exp`) is processed character by character.
   - If a **whitespace** is encountered, it is skipped.

3. **Handling Operands:**
   - If a **digit** is found (`isdigit(exp[i])`), the program reads the full number (handling multi-digit numbers).
   - The parsed integer is pushed onto the stack.

4. **Handling Operators:**
   - If an **operator** is found (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`):
     - The top **two** elements are popped from the stack.
     - The operation is performed:  
       - `+` â†’ Addition  
       - `-` â†’ Subtraction  
       - `*` â†’ Multiplication  
       - `/` â†’ Division (checks for division by zero)
       - `^` â†’ Exponentiation (using a loop)
     - The result is **pushed back** onto the stack.

5. **Final Result:**
   - After processing the entire expression, the last remaining element in the stack is the final result.

### **Example Execution for "2 3 4 * + 16 2 3 ^ / -"**
#### **Postfix Expression Breakdown:**
```
Step 1: Push 2         â†’ Stack: [2]
Step 2: Push 3         â†’ Stack: [2, 3]
Step 3: Push 4         â†’ Stack: [2, 3, 4]
Step 4: Perform 3 * 4  â†’ 12  â†’ Stack: [2, 12]
Step 5: Perform 2 + 12 â†’ 14  â†’ Stack: [14]
Step 6: Push 16        â†’ Stack: [14, 16]
Step 7: Push 2         â†’ Stack: [14, 16, 2]
Step 8: Push 3         â†’ Stack: [14, 16, 2, 3]
Step 9: Perform 2 ^ 3  â†’ 8   â†’ Stack: [14, 16, 8]
Step 10: Perform 16 / 8 â†’ 2  â†’ Stack: [14, 2]
Step 11: Perform 14 - 2 â†’ 12 â†’ Stack: [12]
```
**Final Result = `12`**

### **Time Complexity Analysis:**
- **O(n)** (Linear) â†’ Each character is processed once, and stack operations (push/pop) take constant time **O(1)**.

### **Key Features:**
- **Handles multi-digit numbers** correctly.
- **Uses a stack efficiently** for postfix evaluation.
- **Includes error handling** (e.g., division by zero, invalid characters).
