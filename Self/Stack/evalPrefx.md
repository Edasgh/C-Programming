This C program evaluates a **prefix (Polish notation) expression** using a **stack-based approach**. Here's how it works:

---

## **Approach Used:**
1. **Stack Data Structure:**  
   - A stack (`Stack[MAX]`) is used to store operands during the evaluation.
   - `push()` and `pop()` functions handle stack operations.

2. **Reverse Traversal of the Expression:**
   - Unlike postfix evaluation, which processes expressions **left to right**, **prefix expressions** are evaluated **right to left**.

3. **Handling Operands:**
   - If a **digit** is encountered (`isdigit(exp[i])`), the program reads the **full number** (handling multi-digit cases).
   - The parsed integer is pushed onto the stack.

4. **Handling Operators:**
   - If an **operator** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`) is found:
     - The **top two operands** are popped from the stack.
     - The corresponding operation is performed:
       - `+` â†’ Addition  
       - `-` â†’ Subtraction  
       - `*` â†’ Multiplication  
       - `/` â†’ Division (handles division by zero)
       - `^` â†’ Exponentiation (using a loop)
     - The **result is pushed back** onto the stack.

5. **Final Result:**
   - After processing the entire expression, the stack contains a single value, which is the **final result**.

## **Example Execution for "- + 2 * 3 4 / 16 ^ 2 3"**
### **Prefix Expression Breakdown:**
```
Expression: "- + 2 * 3 4 / 16 ^ 2 3"
```
### **Reverse traversal and stack operations:**
| Step | Symbol | Action | Stack |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1    | `3`    | Push 3 | [3] |
| 2    | `2`    | Push 2 | [3, 2] |
| 3    | `^`    | Compute 2^3 â†’ 8 | [8] |
| 4    | `16`   | Push 16 | [8, 16] |
| 5    | `/`    | Compute 16/8 â†’ 2 | [2] |
| 6    | `4`    | Push 4 | [2, 4] |
| 7    | `3`    | Push 3 | [2, 4, 3] |
| 8    | `*`    | Compute 3*4 â†’ 12 | [2, 12] |
| 9    | `2`    | Push 2 | [2, 12, 2] |
| 10   | `+`    | Compute 2+12 â†’ 14 | [14, 2] |
| 11   | `-`    | Compute 14-2 â†’ 12 | [12] |

**Final Result = `12`**

## **Time Complexity Analysis:**
- **O(n)** (Linear) â†’ Each character is processed once, and stack operations (push/pop) take constant time **O(1)**.

## **Key Features:**
âœ” **Handles multi-digit numbers** correctly.  
âœ” **Efficient stack-based approach** for prefix evaluation.  
âœ” **Includes error handling** (e.g., division by zero, invalid characters).
